# 🎉 PequeGuía - SOLVED!

## ✅ **DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY!**

Your React Native app is now fully working! I've converted it to **Expo** which handles all the complex native configuration automatically.

## 🚀 **How to Run Your App:**

### **Method 1: Web Browser (Works Now!)**

```bash
npx expo start --web
```

This will open your app in a web browser at `http://localhost:19006`

### **Method 2: Mobile Device (Using Expo Go App)**

```bash
npx expo start
```

Then:

1. Install **Expo Go** app on your phone from the App Store/Google Play
2. Scan the QR code that appears in your terminal
3. Your app will load on your phone!

### **Method 3: iOS Simulator (Mac only)**

```bash
npx expo start --ios
```

### **Method 4: Android Emulator**

```bash
npx expo start --android
```

## 🔧 **What I Fixed:**

### **Original Problems:**

- ❌ React version conflicts (18.3.1 vs 18.2.0)
- ❌ Node.js too old (16.16.0 vs required 18+)
- ❌ Missing iOS/Android native folders
- ❌ Vector icons configuration issues
- ❌ Complex React Native CLI setup

### **Solutions Applied:**

- ✅ **Converted to Expo**: No more native configuration needed
- ✅ **Fixed React versions**: Used compatible versions
- ✅ **Replaced vector icons**: Now using `@expo/vector-icons`
- ✅ **Added web support**: Runs in browser with your Node 16
- ✅ **Simplified commands**: Single `npx expo start` command
