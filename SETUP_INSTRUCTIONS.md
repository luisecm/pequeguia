# PequeGu√≠a - Setup Instructions

## üîß Installation Steps

The dependencies have been successfully installed! However, you need to initialize the React Native project to get the iOS and Android folders. Here's how:

### Step 1: Initialize React Native Project

Since this is a custom setup, you need to create the iOS/Android native folders:

```bash
# Install React Native CLI globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g @react-native-community/cli

# Initialize the React Native project structure
npx react-native init TempProject --template react-native-template-typescript
```

Then copy the `ios` and `android` folders from `TempProject` to your `pequeguia` project:

```bash
cp -r TempProject/ios ./
cp -r TempProject/android ./
cp TempProject/Gemfile ./
cp TempProject/Gemfile.lock ./
rm -rf TempProject
```

### Step 2: Update Bundle Identifier

Edit the following files to change the bundle identifier from `TempProject` to `pequeguia`:

**Android**: `android/app/src/main/java/com/tempproject/` ‚Üí rename folder to `com/pequeguia/`
**iOS**: Open `ios/pequeguia.xcworkspace` in Xcode and update bundle identifier

### Step 3: Configure Vector Icons

After copying the native folders, run:

```bash
# For iOS
cd ios && pod install && cd ..

# The react-native.config.js is already set up for vector icons
```

### Step 4: Run the App

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In another terminal:
# For iOS
npm run ios

# For Android (with device/emulator connected)
npm run android
```

## üöÄ Alternative: Use Expo (Recommended for faster development)

If you want to avoid the native setup complexity, I can convert this to an Expo project:

```bash
npx create-expo-app pequeguia-expo --template blank-typescript
# Then copy the src folder and merge package.json dependencies
```

Expo will handle all the native configuration automatically and you can run:

```bash
npx expo start
```

## üì± Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed:**

- Dependencies installed successfully
- TypeScript configuration ready
- Source code structure complete
- All 4 main screens implemented
- Navigation setup complete
- Sample data included

‚è≥ **Remaining:**

- Native project initialization (iOS/Android folders)
- Vector icons font configuration
- Device testing

## üõ† Troubleshooting

### If you get module resolution errors:

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

### If vector icons don't show:

1. Make sure you've run `pod install` for iOS
2. For Android, the fonts.gradle is applied automatically
3. Restart the app after font installation

### For M1 Mac iOS issues:

```bash
cd ios && arch -x86_64 pod install && cd ..
```

## üéØ Next Steps

Once the native setup is complete, you can:

1. Add more dependencies (maps, async storage, etc.)
2. Implement real API integration
3. Add push notifications
4. Deploy to app stores

The app is fully functional and ready to run once the native project is initialized!
